# IntelliJ-Config
These are my personal code style definitions and color themes for IntelliJ IDEA.

## Installation
Copy the two folders in this project (`codestyles` and `colors`) into the `config` folder inside the `.IntelliJIdea` folder and restart Idea.

## Colors
Color Themes are selectable in Settings at Editor >> Colors & Fonts.

## Code Styles
Code Styles are managed in Settings at Editor >> Code Style.  Click the "Manage" button and a default scheme can be set for all projects.  With a project open in Idea, click the "Manage" then "Copy to Project".  This will insert the XML file into the `.idea` directory of the project.
